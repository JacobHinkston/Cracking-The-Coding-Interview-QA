<h2>What is this repo for?</h2>
<p>
    This repo was designed to serve as a database of common interview questions that are seen in many SWE interviews. I will post a new question daily.
</p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>
    The interview questions are organized by 1. Topic, or 2. Difficulty. Start where ever you feel comfortable. The goal is to complete all 189 questions, one day at a time. One question a-day keeps the brain farts away! Stay sharp and code on so that you can slay that next coding interview! 
    <br>
    I plan on adding questions from Code practicing websites like
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>
        </li>
         <li>
            <a href="http://topcoder.com/">Topcoder</a>
        </li>
         <li>
            <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>
        </li>
         <li>
            <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/">InterviewBit</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Remember to always practice your code by WRITING it out first. White boarding is best but pen/paper also works. Describe your thought process OUT LOUD. This will help you with 'stage fright' when you get up in front of someone to white-board it. White-boarding code takes practice!
